<h1>introduction:</h1>
<pre><h3>A technology that is capable of providing an environment which enables users to transmit data from one device 
to other device without the use of any physical link/cables is known as Mobile Computing.
It means, data transmission is done wireless-ly with the help of wireless devices such as mobiles, laptops etc.
Whenever any device is connected to a network without being connected physically over a link or cable, data transmission 
such as messages, voice recording, videos etc. can be done be done by using the concept of mobile computing.
Mobile Computing technology helps users to access and transmit data from any remote locations without being present there 
physically.
Thus, having such a big coverage diameter, it is one of the fastest and most reliable sectors of computing technology field.</h3></pre>
<h1>What is meant by mobile computing ?</h1>
